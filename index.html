    <h4>Biography :</h4>
    <p class="about">
       Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, 
       anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead
       the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.
       He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
       Gandhi led nation wide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, 
       building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability.
       Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi)
       Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. 
       He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.
